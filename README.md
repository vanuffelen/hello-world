# hello-world
This is the description of the hello-world repository. 
I'm now making changes in the readme-edits branche... or at least, I *think* I am. 
My name is **Tanja van Uffelen**. I've been with IBM since 1 Aug 1984, so it's almost been 38 years. 
I have been working on Information Development and Design (IDD) for zSecure. Before I came to zSecure: 
1. I was a secretary.
2. I worked in IDD.
3. I designed an internal communications site and then filled it with content
- as part of AMS
- as part of 'internal communications'. 
The zSecure Suite site is on IBM Documentation: [zSecure Suite](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/szs)
